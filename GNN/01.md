## Tasks

four categories based on researchers’ goals: Detection, Surveil- lance, Prediction, and Projection

### Detection

The goal of detection tasks is to identify health states, disease spread, or other related incidents that happened at a speciic time.

*source detection* and *transmission detection*

**数学表述：** 给定一个时间维度的图序列 $G = \{ G_0, G_1,\dots, G_T \}$ , 其中 $G_t$ 的顶点和边的状态可以表示为 $S_t^V$ 和$S_t^{\varepsilon}$ . Detection的任务可以表示为给定 $G_T$ 和 $t$ ，预测 $S_t^V$ 和 $S_t^{\varepsilon}$ .



### Surveillance

Surveillance tasks aim at providing **timely** and accurate information to support decision-making and disease prevention. Since a prompt response is needed, **real-time** processing ability has been the most important requirement during modeling. 

**数学表述：** 给定一个时间维度的图序列 $G = \{ G_0, G_1,\dots, G_T \}$ , 快速计算 $G_T$ 上的一个统计量 $Y$ .



### Prediction

Similar to surveillance tasks, prediction tasks also aim to forecast epidemic events using historical data. Prediction tasks typically involve **longer time spans** and **do not require real-time processing**.

**数学表述：** 给定一个时间维度的图序列 $G = \{ G_0, G_1,\dots, G_T \}$ , 预测 $G_{T+1}$ .

- *Incidence Prediction.* The target of incidence prediction is to provide quantitative result. 
  - Incidences can include the number of infections or deaths in the future, inluenza activity level, InluenzaLike Illness (ILI) rates, vaccine hesitancy, etc.
- *Trend Prediction.* The target of trend prediction tasks is to identify a higher-level epidemic spreading pattern.
  - prediction of infection trend can be described as an information retrieving problem and the goal is to predict the next region to be infected given a historic spreading route.



### Projection

In epidemic forecasting, projection tasks are similar to prediction, but with an additional intention to understand epidemic outcomes. These tasks usually require models with the ability to **incorporate changes during the evolving of epidemics**, such as external interventions and changing of initial states.

**数学表述：** 给定一个时间维度的图 $G = \{ V(t), \varepsilon(t) \}$ , 策略 $P_v(t)$ 和策略 $P_{\varepsilon}(t)$ 分别影响图的顶点状态和连接状态。目标是寻找最大化或最小化目标的最优策略。

比如说如何限制疾病扩散，applying quarantine level to nodes or restricting mobility on edges.



### Perspectives from Data Scientists

- **模型输入** 输入都为节点特征以及图结构。从时空上进行分类可以分为 **spatial- only tasks**, **temporal-only**, and **spatial-temporal tasks.** 对于graph structure的时效性和学习性上，可以使用**static**和**dynamic**特征进行区分。
- **模型输出**  scalar, graph, and action sequence. 





## Neural Models 

Neural Models primarily focus on a data-driven approach and leverage the power of deep learning (i.e., GNNs in our paper) to uncover complex patterns in disease dynamics *without explicit encoding of the underlying epidemio- logical processes*. 

(a) **Spatial Dynamics Modeling**, (b) **Temporal Dynamics Modeling**, and (c) I**ntervention Modeling**. This categorization is designed to speciically tackle the challenges of modeling the spatial spread, temporal evolution, and the impact of intervention strategies through the advanced capabilities of GNNs.



### Spatial Dynamics Modeling

In the context of GNN modeling, **the signiicance of edge weights is paramount**, as they encapsulate the intensity and nature of interactions. Within epidemiological studies, these weights are often de- rived from the mobility or social connectedness between regions.  

To further enhance the spatial context of each node within the graph, some research advocates for the implementation of **positional encoding techniques**. These techniques are designed to augment the nodes’ **spatial awareness**.



#### Adaptive Structure Learning

Occasions when **adjacency relationship information is not available** in the real world, often due to data scarcity.

Additionally, inspired by recent advancements in attention-based mechanisms, a considerable portion of research suggests the *use of an attention matrix to illustrate the relationships between nodes*.



#### **Multi-Scale Modeling**

For epidemiological tasks, multi-scale modeling is imperative for capturing the dynamics of disease spread across these varied levels, from individual behaviors to global dissemination, ensuring a more comprehensive analysis. 



### Temporal Dynamics Modeling

A particular strand of research utilizes RNN-based models (e.g., LSTM or GRU), as mechanisms to extract node features. These features are then incorporated into the graph convolution process.

In contrast to the initial two methodologies, numerous studies achieve their inal output by iteratively layering GNN and temporal models.



### Intervention Modeling

 Intervention modeling ofers a detailed perspective on epidemic spread by simulating the behaviors and interactions of individuals within a network based on intervention strategies.



## Hybrid Models 

Unlike Neural Models described above, Hybrid Models efectively combine the predictive capabilities of neural networks with the foundational principles of mechanistic models, thereby enhancing both the accuracy and interpretability of disease forecasting.



### Parameter Estimation for Mechanistic Model

This line of research highlights that hybrid models, which integrate neural networks, d**ynamically adjust the parameters of mechanistic models**. This combination enables the analysis of real-time data, thus informing and reining mechanistic models to ensure their simulations accurately mirror the dynamics of actual epidemic.



### Mechanistic-Informed Neural Models

Mechanistic-informed neural models utilize domain knowledge from mechanistic models to inform the architecture and learning processes of GNNs.  This strategy flexibility **allows for a swift adaptation to changing conditions**, markedly **improving the accuracy of forecasts and the efectiveness of interventions**.





## FUTURE WORK

### Epidemic at Scale

Multi-scale data are crucial in epidemiology because they ofer comprehensive insights into both intra-region and inter-region re- lationships, thus aiding in the more accurate modeling of disease spread. 

**现状** Existing approaches are limited to processing only two predeined scales, such as county-level and state-level data. Looking ahead, there is growing anticipation for the development of novel models capable of incorporating data across multiple dynamic scales and adaptable to diverse epidemiological tasks.

Meanwhile, scalability must also be considered for numerous reasons: (1) A smaller granularity results in the expansion of graph data. (2) Some tasks require real-time processing



### Cross-Modality in Epidemiology

 Although GNNs are very suitable for information aggregation and handling multi-modality data, there has not been much work exploring the multi-modality of GNNs in an epidemiology setting. Some related works have utilized unstructured data like textual or image data to construct node features. However, there is no **cross-modality** in their work in terms of node features. 



### Epidemic Difusion Process

The difusion process, which is the key component in epidemiologi- cal tasks, can be both spatial and temporal.

- In the real world, dis- ease spreading is a continuous process, which is incompatible with current methods. 
- Another problem lies in that both disease spreading and infection take time, and they can happen asynchronously.



### Interventions for Epidemics 

They include intervention strategies like vaccination, quarantine, and public health education to limit transmission and minimize outbreaks, ultimately saving lives and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.

Among the methods mentioned in this paper, most of the research incorporates intervention strategy in agent-based models or other neural models. Generally, the interventions in these methods include deleting nodes, altering nodes, and altering edge weights. However, each method only includes one type of intervention, either node-level or edge-level.

 In the real world, however, interventions can happen at diferent graph levels and also at diferent scales. To better model the real situation, multi-level and multi-scale interventions need to be introduced. 混合的策略

Therefore, interpretability is essential and ofers various beneits, including **understanding disease dynamics**, **identifying risk factors**, and **providing measures of uncertainty**.
